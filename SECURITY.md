## Reporting

Email: evenweaker@disroot.org with subject `[SECURITY] siren`.

## Rules for reports

- Test on your own machines. Do not probe the office box or anyone else's host.
- Never include passwords, keys, mail bodies, client names, NIFs, or ROMs.
- Bulwark/Seal: unprivileged sandbox first; no destructive firewall/iptables flushes on shared nets.
